OmiseGO's public research repository.

## Background

OmiseGO is publishing research documents in an effort to generally improve transparency, increase community engagement, and advance the state of research. These documents range from train-of-thought-style research notes to finalized specifications.

**Comments, feedback, and improvements are more than welcome! Feel free to create issues or pull requests where you see fit.**

This repository isn't just for OmiseGO! Anyone is welcome to create pull requests containing original research. Please make sure that any content submitted is properly attributed.

## Scope

This repository is designed to host any research related to, or tangentially related to, OmiseGO. If you need inspiration, we're currently thinking about [Plasma](https://plasma.io/plasma.pdf), [Plasma Cash](https://ethresear.ch/t/plasma-cash-plasma-with-much-less-per-user-data-checking/1298), and [Decentralized Exchanges](https://cdn.omise.co/omg/whitepaper.pdf) in general (and much more).

Check out some of the documents in this repository if you're unsure that your work will fit.
